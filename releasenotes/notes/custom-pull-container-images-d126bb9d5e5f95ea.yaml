    Currently, only Kolla's playbooks include the ability to trigger the pull of the
    necessary container images via an action. So that also further necessary container
    images can be downloaded befor the deployment these were added temporarily in a
    play `pull-container-images` in the environment `custom`. The play can be removed
    in the future if the pull of the container images listed there is otherwise possible.
